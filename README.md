# bpyBullet
library to link the blender python api (bpy) with pyBullet.

This is by no means a library covering the full functionality of pyBullet, but I will probably add more functionality when I need it. 
Maybe it is still useful for some, also in the current crude state.

The [examples](examples) are currently the best way to learn how to use this library.

## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/TobiasLe/bpyBullet.git
python -m pip install -e ./bpyBullet/
```
Make sure that you run this with the python installation which is used by blender.
